Here’s the updated README.md reflecting the correct frontend directory structure (product-webapp/webapp):

📦 Apna-Pharmacy Website (Microservices Architecture)

This project is a Pharmacy Website built using Spring Boot (Java) for backend microservices and Angular for frontend. The system follows a microservices architecture, where each service is deployed separately and communicates via RabbitMQ for messaging. The project is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

🚀 Tech Stack

Backend (Microservices)
	•	Spring Boot (Java)
	•	Spring Cloud Config (For centralized configuration management)
	•	Spring Data JPA (For database interaction)
	•	RabbitMQ (For inter-service messaging)
	•	Spring Security + JWT (For authentication)
	•	H2 / PostgreSQL / MySQL (Database)

Frontend
	•	Angular (Client-side application) (Located inside product-webapp/webapp)

DevOps & Deployment
	•	Docker (Containerization)
	•	Docker Compose (To orchestrate microservices)
	•	RabbitMQ (Message Broker)

📂 Microservices Overview

The system is composed of the following microservices:

Service Name	Description
API Gateway	Entry point to the system, routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
User Service	Manages user registration, authentication (JWT), and authorization.
Order Service	Handles orders, payment processing, and order tracking.
Cart Service	Manages the shopping cart for users.
Product Service	Manages pharmacy products, inventory, and categories.
Notification Service	Sends email/SMS notifications using RabbitMQ.
Config Server	Manages external configurations for all services.

🛠️ Setting Up the Project

1️⃣ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
	•	JDK 17+
	•	Maven
	•	Node.js + npm (For Angular)
	•	Docker & Docker Compose
	•	RabbitMQ (Can be started using Docker)

2️⃣ Running Microservices Individually

Each microservice is a standalone Spring Boot application. You can run them manually using:

cd <service-directory>
mvn spring-boot:run

For example, to start the Order Service:

cd order-service
mvn spring-boot:run

3️⃣ Running the Frontend (Angular)

Navigate to the Angular project directory (product-webapp/webapp) and start the development server:

cd product-webapp/webapp
npm install
ng serve --open

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:4200.

🐳 Running with Docker

To run the entire system using Docker, use:

docker-compose up --build

This will:
	1.	Build and start all microservices.
	2.	Launch RabbitMQ for inter-service communication.
	3.	Start the API Gateway.
	4.	Deploy the Angular frontend from product-webapp/webapp.

🔄 Inter-Service Communication

Microservices communicate through RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging. Example flow:
	•	When an order is placed in Order Service, it sends a message to RabbitMQ.
	•	The Notification Service listens for order events and sends an email confirmation.

RabbitMQ Management Console (for monitoring queues):

http://localhost:15672

(Default Username: guest, Password: guest)

🧪 API Endpoints

Each microservice exposes RESTful APIs:

User Service
	•	POST /api/users/register → Register a new user
	•	POST /api/users/login → Authenticate user
	•	GET /api/users/profile → Fetch user profile

Order Service
	•	POST /api/orders/place → Place a new order
	•	GET /api/orders/{orderId} → Get order details

Cart Service
	•	POST /api/cart/add → Add item to cart
	•	GET /api/cart → Get cart items

More API endpoints are available in each microservice’s documentation.

🔐 Authentication & Security
	•	JWT Authentication is used to secure endpoints.
	•	Secure APIs require Authorization: Bearer <token> in headers.

📜 Environment Variables

Each service requires a .env file with the following variables:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
RABBITMQ_HOST=rabbitmq
RABBITMQ_PORT=5672
RABBITMQ_USER=guest
RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=guest
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

Update these values as needed.

🎯 Future Enhancements
	•	Add Kubernetes for orchestration.
	•	Implement Redis caching for improved performance.
	•	Add monitoring using Prometheus & Grafana.
